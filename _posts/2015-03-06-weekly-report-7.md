This is our fourth weekly report of the semester

This week I spent most of my efforts on Zeebo calculating water displacements in order to achieve neutral buoyancy. This involved two different things:

1. Calculate the weight of each of the components we can
2. Calculate the weight of the water displaced by the robot

 You can see my work in the spreadsheet below.

##Calculating the weight of our components:
Some of our components we were able to pull weights off of datasheets. This included most of the electronic components, visible in rows 4-9. The rest of the items, however, had to be calculated.
###Aluminum Pieces
Luckily, for the aluminum pieces we have, I was able to find an online calculator which calculated the weight of each of our pieces easily.
