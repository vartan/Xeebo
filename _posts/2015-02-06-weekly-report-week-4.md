##ÂµControllers

This week I began working on the LPC11u24, our microcontroller we will be using for the majority of our boards. Brent Scheneman chose the [LPC11u24 LPCXpresso Board](http://www.embeddedartists.com/products/lpcxpresso/lpc11U24_xpr.php) as our breakout board to begin development/testing while our other boards are being designed.

Unfortunately, this week I lack the hardware required to actually test the board, and don't have access to a windows computer to debug code using Keil. I have been building with the LPCXpresso software for mac, and will begin ASAP.

##Motor Drivers
I have been primarily working on starting the motor drivers.
