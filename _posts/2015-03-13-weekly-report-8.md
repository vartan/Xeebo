This is our fifth weekly report of the semester

#Brent Scheneman

##JTAG Adapter Cable
I started off the week by making the JTAG adapter cable which will allow us to program the LPCXpresso board using a stand alone JTAG programmer like Segger's J-Link device. The adapter converts the 2x10 pin connector configuration on the J-Link to the 1x8 pin header on the LPCXpresso.

##Week's Summarry
This week I went from design to construction to test of the structure.

##The findings:
The weight of the structure is low enough such that we have the potential to achieve netural buoyancy.

The calculations for neutral buoyancy were incorrect as the volume of the motors were not factored into the original calculations. On Thursday night we put the structure sans the motors and electronic equipment into the pool and it floated. After the approx 10 lbs of motors and equipment are added to the craft it will approach slight negative buoyancy. 

However, the structure was designed with a large apparatus on the bottom that was to articulate with the yaw/pitch/ascend/descend thrusters and the payload. This caused the craft to tent to upright itself. This would have been ideal if we wanted to have a robot that stayed upright.

However since we are designing the UUV to be completely maneuverable in all directions the structure must be symmetrical.

The structure is going to be reimplemented with a symmetrical design with fewer materials. 

The savings in weight are going to be calculated and included in the next report, and a mathematical analysis of the structure will be done in order to calculate the the neutral buoyancy volume/weight point do design and refine to.
##Monday
80/20 material was transferred to ME team to be cut for a design I was to make this week. The requirement was to have exact measurements to be cut by the ME team once and only once.

Tested the frame by submerging it in the pool. The next task is to redesign and reconstruct a symmetrical frame and reduce the weight of the craft by 2-5 pounds.
