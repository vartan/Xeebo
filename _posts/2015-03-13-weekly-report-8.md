This is our fifth weekly report of the semester

##JTAG Adapter Cable
I started off the week by making the JTAG adapter cable which will allow us to program the LPCXpresso board using a stand alone JTAG programmer like Segger's J-Link device. The adapter converts the 2x10 pin connector configuration on the J-Link to the 1x8 pin header on the LPCXpresso.
