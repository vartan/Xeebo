This is our sixth weekly report of the semester

##Thruster Controller Board

This week I focused on re-designing the thruster controller board. The schematic for the old H-Bridge drivers was complete and the board layout was nearly complete. It was decided to change the driver chip that we are using to reduce board space and complexity, which ultimately reduces the risk of system failures and board manufacturing costs. With the new driver, there will be 5 less IC's on the board per thruster. So this week I created new part board layouts for the new compoenents, including the new driver. I completely redesigned the schematic to work with the new drivers and made quite a bit of progress on the board layout. As seen in the pictures below, the board layouts for the individual drivers are designed. Next thing to do will be connecting the microcontroller to the drivers.

##Main Computer Power Board

Last week we recieved the power board for the Main Computer. This coming week I'll conduct a few tests to see if the board will do what we need it to (low noise, proper voltage output, etc.) before proceding forward in actually powerin the computer.
