Thanks to all of the work of our team members, Xeebo had its first successful underwater test and is now swimming in the water! 

We have done extensive testing before putting the entire system in the water. We have seperately tested the controls, the motors, and the communication systems. Each system was shown to work correctly to our specifications. Despite that, we tested the submarine with limited thrusting capacity to just make sure that the systems worked correctly, and more thorough tests will now follow. 

The video below demonstrates our progress so far. The Xeebo UUV is currently controlled by a Dualshock controller, with wired packets being sent from a microcontroller above water to the control system within the submarine hull. Brent Scheneman is driving the UUV, and Matt and Sam are standing by in the water with the submarine.
