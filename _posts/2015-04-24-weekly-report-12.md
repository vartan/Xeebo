###First Autonomous Test of Zeebo
We have celebrated a major milestone in the development of our project. On Monday 4/20/2015 we conducted the first autonomous test of Zeebo traversing under its own command.

Zeebo was programmed to drive forward for 10 seconds, wait 10 seconds, then drive in reverse for 10 seconds. The pattern was set to repeat 5 times.

My contribution to the success of this test was the mechanical design and assembly of the frame.

### Zeebo on Display

The two major design requirements  of the frame were such that Zeebo would be
1. Neurally Buoyant
2. Fully maneuverable (Yaw/Pitch, Ascend/Descend, Forward/Reverse, Rotate, and Roll)

### Ready for Deployment

We have enjoyed continued success with the design from the mechanical and waterproofing standpoint. Our gasket has not allowed any water seepage at depths from 0 to 5 feet which we have tested.

## Structural Issues That were Revised
After our first test, it was found that the way in which the frame articulated with the hull prevented easy access to the electronics payload and contributed to a high level of difficulty in removing the front cover.

## Pre Test Troubleshooting
I refined the design and purchased new parts and reassembled the mountain components. The cover can be removed in a fraction of the time it took previously.

### Isometric 3D  Drawing

I assisted Brent and Michael in debugging the electronics and software.

I provided my support and  input  to Brent in troubleshooting the inverter issue and I assisted Michael in debugging the UART ISR problem, which Michael eventually solved.

The team assisted me in the final checks and maintenance in the structure before we deployed.

## Next Steps
Brent has helped me source an actuator that I will use in the design of the torpedo launching system. 

### Actuator
CAT# SOL-143
![Actuator Pic](/images/sam_week_12_actuator.png)
MAGNETIC LATCHING SOLENOID, 33VDC

MSA (Magnet Schultz of America). 33 Vdc 17 ohm D-Frame, magnetic latching solenoid. Intermittent-duty. Built-in permanent magnet holds the plunger in fully-retracted position until it is manually (or mechanically) extracted. Plunger is equipped with a U-shaped pin that can be used for pull-type operation. Spring and clip keep plunger away from magnet when not energized. 42 x 40 x 36mm (1.65 x 1.55 x 1.40"). Two 6.5" leads terminate to 2-pin Molex-type socket. Plunger is 0.50" diameter x 2.01" long.
