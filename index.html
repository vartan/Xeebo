    Welcome to the Zeebo Team website! This website has been created for us to 
    publicly keep track of the progress of our project. You may be asking 
    yourself, <b>what is Zeebo</b>?
  </p>

  <p>
    Zeebo is an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) being developed by students 
    at California State University, Long Beach with the goal of competing in the
    AUVSI Robosub competition. In order to compete, Zeebo must be able to 
    autonomously control itself underwater using vision systems and other
    awareness sensors. It will be required to perform a series of tasks
    suited to underwater robotics.
